    documentation="Electric car-sharing is an available resource for passengers travelling to Malpensa Airport. However, in case of a disruption, e.g., maintenance work in the railway network, demand for use can exceed supply. A bundling algorithm can determine possible matches of users and prioritize higher occupancy of cars, to accommodate demand.&#xA;"/>
