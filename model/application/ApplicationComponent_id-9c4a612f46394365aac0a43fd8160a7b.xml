    documentation="System for collecting transport credentials is in the form of verifiable credentials linked to a passenger identity. Each passenger is equipped with an IOTA Identity. Once a passenger redirection because of some disruption is needed, the Traffic Orchestrator issues a transport credential for the given passenger based on the input of optimisation tools. &#xA;The functionalities are accessible using REST APIs for the passenger to create their identities and for Traffic Orchestrator to issue transport credentials. A transport credential wallet can also be developed for facilitating the collection of transport credentials by passengers.&#xA;&#xA;Use in LL and sim:&#xA;In case of disruptions a matching algorithm matches passengers to available electric vehicles and issues transport credentials linking the vehicle to the passenger. The transport provider or the vehicle can then verify and authorise the passenger to travel with the given vehicle.&#xA;After use, a passenger can collect a credential as a reward/attestation for green travel using electric vehicles. This can be used in future to also decide priorities in accessing green transport modes.&#xA;"/>
